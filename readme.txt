Footer Slideup Form adds Feedburner Email Subscription form into the footer where user's can subscribe to your RSS feed using email. 

== Description ==

Footer Slideup Form is one of the best ways to ask your user to subscribe to your list without any interruption or blocking and this plugin does exactly that. It adds an FeedBurner subscribe sliding form in the footer of your Wordpress blog. 

I use and recommend <A HREF="http://imtips.co/feedburner-vs-aweber.html">AWeber over Feedburner</A> for RSS to email but my blog readers wanted to have Slideup plugin for Feedburner like I have for AWeber.

== Installation ==

Please Follow the exact Steps to install and activate this plugin.

   1. Activate Email Subscription for your Feed in Feedburner.
   2. Grab the HTML code of your HTML Form and Search for uri=SomeString. SomeString is your unique identifier for your Feedburner feed.
   3. Upload the plugin folder feedburner-footer-slideup at wp-content/plugins.
   4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
   5. Edit Options under the Menu 'Feedburner Footer SlideUp'. Paste the FeedBurner URI String generated in Step 2.
